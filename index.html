                    <div class="game-desc">
                        <p>The classic Survival Games meets a new style! Be careful not to get lost in our expansive Japanese style map, it may be a little easier than before! You will not spawn next to all of your teammates, but rather, be randomly shuffled amongst your rivals. Make sure to meet up with your team before the grace period ends!</p>
                        <p>Our loot pool is made in an effort to ensure survivability. Nobody likes when they get two-hit by somebody with a random diamond axe. We want to make sure EVERYBODY has the chance to enjoy their surroundings as they fight to the death! But there are other dangers to consider: fall damage is on, the border is closing in.</p>
                        <p class="points">Points are distributed individually for kills, survival, and for winning! The more of your team lives until the end, the further ahead you'll get. May the odds be ever in your favor!</p>

                    <div class="game-desc">
                        <p>Race to be the fastest on our fantasy-European-mountain-castle map! (yes it's a complex theme okay?) Don't get distracted by the duels or waterfalls, or you might miss a jump pad or spot of levitation... Avoid the potholes and cobwebs blocking your path, and make sure not to fall off the mountain entirely! We don't want to do that kind of paperwork.</p>
                        <p class="points">This is a placement-based game, so the closer you are to the front of the pack, the better you will do! Keep an eye on where your going and where the others are going, you might be able to find a faster way of overcoming a challenge.</p>

                        <p>Welcome to King of the Hill! It's a basic game. 4 teams will be in each area (2 arenas). You will all race to the top of the hill, and try and capture the capture point (by standing on it)! The team who wins in each arena will go into a finale with the other winning team! First team to 200 points wins.</p>

                        <p>Block Shuffle is an intense survival minigame where players have to quickly find and stand on the correct block type or get eliminated.</p>
                        <p>Players start on a platform filled with different colored glazed terracotta blocks that have unique patterns like circles, squares, triangles, and other shapes. Every round, the game announces which block pattern players need to find and stand on. After a few seconds, all the wrong blocks disappear, and anyone not standing on the right block falls into the void and gets eliminated.</p>

                        <p>Sneak behind pipes and cabling, zip between rooms with our vent system, meet an iconic Platypus - Scientist duo, and gaze into the starry abyss! Make sure not to press the self-destruct button or turn off the shields... Spread out and try not to get caught in our sus... "Skold" map! Hiders will be shrunk down to fit in small spaces, seeking safety from one chosen player of each team with the sole goal of hunting down every single hider.</p>
                        <p class="points">Points are awarded to seekers for catching a hider and eliminating a team. Hiders get points for outlasting other hiders. If there are hiders left at the end of the timer, all remaining hiders are granted extra points. If not, every seeker gain points, boosting their individual scores.</p>
